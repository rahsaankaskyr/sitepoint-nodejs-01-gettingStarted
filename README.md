 Learn to build server-side web apps in JavaScript by using Node.js.

Node.js is a JavaScript run-time environment — in other words, it allows us to run JavaScript server-side. Node has been a key part of elevating JavaScript from a front-end interaction language to something that can be taken pretty seriously.

Node’s package manager, npm, also boasts one of the biggest open source libraries in the world.

Whether you’re a PHP or Ruby web developer looking to broaden your job prospects, or a front-end developer who wants to build bigger things, it’s well worth picking up the Node.js skillset.

In this course, you’ll learn about Node API development, setting up your Node.js environment, working with MongoDB and Postman, and extending Node.js with NPM.

We’ll also run through your first Node.js application using a Hello, World! example.
